# Space-O-Sphere Changelog

## Recent Updates (Latest Session)

### üéÆ Frame Rate Control Fix
- **Issue**: Frame rate setting in homepage settings was not affecting the starfield animation
- **Fix**: Implemented proper frame rate limiting in `script.js`
  - Added frame rate control variables with `frameInterval` calculation
  - Modified animation loop to respect user's chosen FPS setting
  - Added `restartStarfieldAnimation()` method to apply frame rate changes dynamically
  - Added settings persistence with localStorage
  - Added `loadSavedSettings()` and `updateSettingsUI()` methods

### üåå APOD Background for Solar System
- **Request**: "adapt the same background of home page for solar system as well"
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added APOD background containers to `solar.html`
  - Added `loadAPOD()` and `displayAPOD()` methods to `solar.js`
  - Solar system page now displays the same dynamic NASA APOD background as homepage

### ‚öôÔ∏è Frame Rate Control for Solar System
- **Request**: "apply frames settings to solar system also"
- **Implementation**:
  - Updated starfield implementation in `solar.js` to match homepage (5000 stars, same positioning)
  - Added frame rate control to solar system animation loop
  - Added settings panel to solar system page with frame rate options (30, 60, 120 FPS)
  - Settings are synchronized between homepage and solar system page via localStorage
  - Added `loadSavedSettings()`, `updateFrameRate()`, `setupSettings()`, and `updateSettingsUI()` methods
  - Frame rate changes now affect both starfield rotation and planet animations

### üì∏ Mars Gallery Size Adjustment
- **Request**: "the fetched images section should be a little small"
- **Changes**: Modified Mars Rover photos gallery in `style.css`
  - Reduced grid template columns from `minmax(150px, 1fr)` to `minmax(120px, 1fr)`
  - Decreased gap from 15px to 12px
  - Reduced image height from 120px to 90px
  - Reduced border radius from 10px to 8px for better proportion

### üåç Real Planet Textures
- **Request**: "for 3 model of planets, take real images of planets from internet and convert them into 3 models"
- **Implementation**: Enhanced `createPlanet()` method in `solar.js`
  - **Earth**: Added atmospheric texture, normal map, and specular map for realistic rendering
  - **Mars**: Added color texture and topographic bump map
  - **Jupiter**: Added high-resolution Jupiter texture
  - Used `MeshPhongMaterial` for better lighting and reflection
  - Removed glow effects for textured planets to maintain realism
  - Other planets retain original colored materials

### üîß Technical Improvements
- Enhanced animation performance with proper frame rate control
- Improved texture loading with error handling
- Better material properties for realistic planet rendering
- Maintained consistent futuristic UI theme across all changes

### üì± User Experience
- Frame rate changes now take immediate effect
- Settings are remembered between sessions
- APOD background provides consistent visual experience across pages
- Smaller Mars gallery maintains functionality while being more compact
- Realistic planet textures enhance the 3D solar system experience
